  <p align="left"><span class="xx-large"><strong>U</strong></span><strong>nless you've been hiding under a rock or   are completely new  to the internet, you'll know that graphics help SELL   a product.</strong> I don't care  what you're selling ' <u>words alone can only do so much</u>,   but graphics will help  your visitors decide if they want to stay on   your website and read your sales  copy or leave there and then.</p>
  <p align="left"> <strong>Good graphics represent <u>you</u>, <u>your business</u> and <u>what you're  selling</u>.</strong> If your site looks tacky, and looks like a home-improvement botched  job, what <em>impression</em> does that leave about your product?</p>
  <p align="left"> It doesn't matter how good   your sales copy is, how valuable  your product actually is, or what   other people are saying through your  testimonials, or even if you're   offering a LIFETIME guarantee. <u>No one would  care</u> and your efforts would   be completely wasted!</p>
  <p align="left">Forget about one-time   offers, upsells, downsells and  cross-sells, tell-a-friend scripts,   tweet me buttons, share this on Facebook  buttons, affiliate programs or   even offering high-ticket items, none of it will  happen because you   didn't make a good first and lasting impression. <u>You did not  impress them!</u></p>
  <p align="left"> Even if you wanted to   collect sign-ups and follow up with  your subscribers with promo emails   for you products and affiliate  recommendations, no one would want to   sign-up because of the first impression  you're leaving on your site!   They'll remember you as 'that's the guy with that  awful website trying   to spam me and sell me junk... I think I'll unsubscribe'... harsh but true.</p>
  <h2 align="left"> <span class="red">graphics is   definitely <u>a top priority</u></span> when it comes to building  an online presence.</h2>
  <p align="left"><strong>Which is why you're here on this page. Today I want to provide you with over 12 months worth of my own personal work to save you time, effort and money.</strong> You don't need a degree in art and design, you don't need to spend hours watching poor quality videos on YouTube, and you definitely won't need to fork out $497+ on a graphic designer.</p>
  <p align="left">What I'm offering is the <strong>RAW and UNFLATTENED PSDs to 27 websites</strong> which I've built in the past to maintain and sustain a solid income online. These originally stemmed from <a href="http://www.platinumresellrights.com" class="blank">resell rights</a> products which were created in the past but now the graphics project are yours to use as you see fit!</p>
  <p align="left">With each website you'll receive the PSD template, eCovers, banners buy now buttons and so much more. And because they're unflattened, you can drag and drop the graphic elements into your own website such as text, logos, people, icons, textures, colors and much more. With these RAW templates you'll be able to get REALLY creative and produce beautiful and profitable websites all by yourself!</p>
